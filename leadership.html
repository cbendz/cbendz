	    with the Students and Technology in Academia, Research and Service (STARS), a program designed to build Leadership skills
	    and participate in service. Since August 2012, I am the coordinator of Students in Programming, Robotics and Computer
	    Science (SPARCS), an outreach program in the Charlotte area aimed to involve k-12 students in Computer Science. </p>

			<big><big><b>M</b></big></big>y participation with Student Leadership
			Corps (SLC) began in the Spring of 2012. This program not only
			brought many experiences and knowledge, it also allowed me to
			network. During my first semester with STARS I was able to meet
			several graduate and Ph. D. students,giving me the oportunity to
			learn from them and to set up better goals towards my Degree. Stars
			also motivated me to make my first <a
				href="images/poster.png">poster</a>
			presentation by the end of the Spring semester, and a couple of
			months later presenting it again at STARS Celebration Conference in
			Hampton, Virginia. <br> <br> The mission of the STARS (Students
			&#38; Technology in Academia, Research &#38; Service) Alliance is to
			increase the participation of women, under-represented minorities,
			and persons with disabilities in computing disciplines through
			multi-faceted interventions. The interventions focus on the influx
			and progression of students from middle school through graduate
			school in programs that lead to computing careers. <br> <br>

			<big><big><b>W</b></big></big>orking with SPARCS was one of the most
			fun volunteering experiences I ever had in my life, this program is
			sponsored by the Charlotte branch of the NSF STARS Alliance. Being
			able to see the process of students realizing how computer science is
			not a career path for boring nerd people, and that instead is a fun
			and creative way to go beyond their imagination was an amazing
			experience. <br> <br> UNCC - SPARCS was initiated over a year
			ago, but it is a program initiated in &#42;October 2007 at North
			Carolina State University, and is now in its fifth year of operation.
			SPARCS is a middle school outreach program aimed at broadening
			participation in computer science. This program offers monthly
			Saturday sessions with hands-on learning activities to introduce
			students to computer science concepts and practical applications
			including Scratch, web design, and LEGO Mindstorm robotics. <br /> <br />
